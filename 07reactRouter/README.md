## This will be used for my personal notes

### Why is Link/NavLink used and not href
reason is coz in react we know theres no refresh page thing it basically compares stuffs and only certiain stuffs are updated but the  'a' tag refreshes entiree page thats why it isnt used and link/navlink is used. href is only a tag same thing

### Why is NavLink used
it is used to manipulate css using a callback in the classname. in the callback is whree u werite yoiur tailwind code and then u can have access to funcitons like isActive isPending that help u manipulate css by checking whether the link u clicked on is actove or no etc etc

### Learnt about layout
used to do nesting. basically we fixed header and footer and then rest everythhing inside we kept dynamic 

### learnt about router
to route to diff pages etc using createBrowserRouter

### learnt about useParams()
used to read and use input parameters

### learnt about Loader()
can be used when u make api calls etc to reduce the lag. basically when we hover on the navbar or anty button itll already fetch the data and keep it ready in the cache and displY IT AS SOON AS WE CLICK IT.
